            Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter
            Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
            Shower you with all my attention
            Yeah, these are my only intentions
            Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread
            Heart full of equity, you're an asset
            Make sure that you don't need no mentions
            Yeah, these are my only intentions

            Shout out to your mom and dad for making you
            Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
            When I create, you're my muse
            The kind of smile that makes the news
